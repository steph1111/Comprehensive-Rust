## About Rust
Rust is modern programming language developed in 2010. It is often compared to C or C++ but does not have the dangers of memory misuse. Rust is designed for speed, efficient and safe memory management, and the ability to run multiple programs in parallel.

Rust documentation may be found on the official [website](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html) or by running the following command in a terminal:
```sh
rustup doc
```

<br>

---
## Getting Started
<br>

### Installing Rust
1. Run the following command in a terminal.
   ```sh
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```
2. Restart the terminal environment.
3. Ensure rust installed by entering the following command.
   ```sh
   rustc --version
   ```
4. Additional installation information may be found [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html).

<br>

### Creating a program
1. Use `touch` to create a file that ends in the file extension `.rs`
   ```sh
   touch hello_world.rs
   ```
2. Compile the code with `rustc`
   ```sh
   rustc hello_world.rs
   ```
3. Run the executable (it will have the same name as the .rs file)
   ```sh
   ./hello_world
   ```

## Exercise: Hello World!
[hello_world.rs](https://github.com/steph1111/Comprehensive-Rust/blob/master/hello_world.rs)
```rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello üåç!");
}
```
- Functions start with `fn`
- Blocks have curly braces `{}`
- Lines end in `;`
- Like C++, rust programs have a `main()` function

<br>

---
## Scalar Types
|     |Types|Literals|
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Signed integers | `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`, `isize` | `-10`, `0`, `1_000`, `123i64` |
| Unsigned integers | `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, `usize` | `0`, `123`, `10u16`| 
| Floating point | `f32`, `f64` | `3.14`, `-10.0e20`, `2f32` | 
| Strings | `&str` | `"foo"`, `"two\nlines"` |
| Unicode scalar values | `char` |	`'a'`, `'Œ±'`, `'‚àû'`
| Boolean | `bool`  | `true`, `false`

<br> 

**Notes:**

- iN, uN, and fN are N bits wide,
- isize and usize are the width of a pointer

<br>

**Embedded double quotes:** # on each side or `\"`

```rs 
println!(r#"<a href="link.html">link</a>"#);
// <a href="link.html">link</a>
```
**Byte strings:** `&[u8]` value directly
```rs
println!("{:?}", b"abc"); // [97, 98, 99]
```

<br> 

---
## Compound Types
|     |Types|Literals|
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Arrays | `[T; N]` | `[20, 30, 40]`, [`0; 3]` | 
| Tuples | `()`, `(T,)`, `(T1, T2)`, ‚Ä¶ | `()`, `('x',)`, `('x', 1.2)`, ‚Ä¶ | 

<br>

### Arrays
```rs
// Mutable array named 'a' of type i8 
// with 10 elements with the value 42 
let mut a: [i8; 10] = [42; 10];
```
- Arrays have the same type `T` and length `N` which at compile time is constant
- The length of an array is part of its type (`[u8; 3]` and `[u8; 4]` are different types)
- Index 5 of array `a` can be accessed by `a[5]`
- Arrays are printable with formatting specifiers: 
  ```rs
  println!("a: {:?}", a);
  // {:?} gives debug output
  // {:#?} gives formatted output
  ```

### Tuples
```rs
// Tuple with t.0 being '7' and t.1 'true'
let t: (i8, bool) = (7, true);
```
- Tuples also have a fixed length 
- Group together elements of *different* types
- Index 5 of a tuple `t` can be accessed by `t.5`
- An empty tuple, `()`, is a ‚Äúunit type‚Äù, it is like void

<br>

---
## References
- References exist in rust
- A reference must be deferenced before assigning to it 
```rs
fn main() {
    let mut x: i32 = 10;
    let ref_x: &mut i32 = &mut x;
    *ref_x = 20;
    println!("x: {x}"); // Prints 20
}
```

<br>

---
## Slices
- Slices allow one to take a subset of a collection of data 
- Slices are created by defining starting and ending indices
- If the start index is 0, you may drop the start index. Same with the last index

```rs
fn main() {
    let mut arr: [i32; 6] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]; // array of type i32 with 6 elements
    println!("arr: {arr:?}"); // Prints with debug formatting
    let slice: &[i32] = &arr[2..4]; // Slices arr from index 2 to 4
    println!("arr slice: {slice:?}") // Prints slice with debug format
}
```

```rs
fn main() {
    let mut arr: [i32; 6] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]; // array of type i32 with 6 elements
    println!("arr: {arr:?}"); // Prints with debug formatting
    let slice: &[i32] = &arr[2..]; // Slices arr from index 2 to end
    println!("arr slice: {slice:?}") // Prints slice with debug format
}
```

<br>

---
## Types of String 
- In rust there are two types of string: `&str` and `string`
- `&str` is a immutable string reference. Like `const char*` in C++
- `string` is a mutable string buffer. Like `std::string` in C++ 

<br>

---
## Functions
- The main() function is always the start of the program 
- Functions are started with `fn` then the function name 
- The parameters are formatted as name then type 
- The last expression in a function body (or any block) becomes the return value. Simply omit the ; at the end of the expression.
- The return type comes after `->`. For void use `-> ()`
```rs
// Function name: is_divisible
// First param: u32 named n 
// Second param: u32 named divisor
// Return type: bool
fn is_divisible(n: u32, divisor: u32) -> bool {
   if divisor == 0 {
      return false; // Explicit return 
   }
   n % divisor == 0 // Last line, implied return
}
```

<br>

---
## Rustdoc 
- Rust code may be documented with `///`
- `///` allows for Markdown formatting
- All published Rust library crates are automatically documented at docs.rs using the rustdoc tool. 

<br>

---
## Methods
- Like in python, methods are defined with `&self` (or `mut &self`) as the first parameter 
```rs
fn area(&self) -> u32 {
   self.width * self.height
}
```

<br> 

---
## Function Overloading
- Function overloading is not supported in Rust
- Default parameters are also not supported
- Template types however are available 


<br>

---
## Implicit Conversions
- Rust will not automatically apply implicit conversions between types. So you cannot multiply a `i8` by a `i16` with no issues.
  
Convert `i8` to `i16`:
```rs
let x: i8 = 15;
let y: i16 = 1000;
```
1. Convert to `i16` with `from<T>`
   ```rs
   println!("{x} * {y} = {}", multiply(i16::from(x), y));
   ```
2. Convert to `i16` with `into<T>`
   ```rs
   println!("{x} * {y} = {}", multiply(x.into(), y));
   ```

<br>

---
## Arrays and for Loops
<br>

### Printing an array with debug format
```rs
fn main() {
   let array = [10, 20, 30];
   println!("array: {array:?}");
}
```
```
array: [10, 20, 30]
```

<br>

### Iterating with for
You can iterate over an array similar to the syntax to python
```rs 
fn main() {
   let array = [10, 20, 30];
   for element in array {
      println!(" {element} ")
   }
}
```
```
10
20
30
```

Or indexing with a range may be used
```rs
fn main() {
   let array = ["hello", "there", "!"];
   for i in 0..3 {
      println!("Element at index {} is {}", i, array[i]);
   }
}
```
```
Element at index 0 is hello
Element at index 1 is there
Element at index 2 is !
```
<br>

### Exercise: Transpose matrix
[transpose_matrix.rs](https://github.com/steph1111/Comprehensive-Rust/blob/master/transpose_matrix.rs)

Print a 3x3 matrix and transpose its rows into columns. Implement a `pretty_print()` function that outputs the matrix in $\LaTeX{}$

<br>

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &  2&  3\\
4 &  5&  6\\
7 &  8&  9\\
\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow  \begin{bmatrix}
1 &  4&  7\\
2 &  5&  8\\
3 &  6&  9\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

<br>

---
## Variable Type Inference 
- The type of a variable may be specified, but it is not required 
- Rust will infer the type based on initialization 
  
<br>

---
## Static and Constant Variables

<br>

### Constant variables
```rs
const PI:f64 = 3.14159265;
```
- Have no fixed address in memory
- They‚Äôre inlined to each place which uses them, this means they are put directly into the binary on the places which use them.
- Usually faster runtime but bigger executable file because it doesn't have to look up an address like static
- Cannot be changed at runtime 

<br>

### Static variables
```rs
static BANNER: &str = "Welcome to RustOS 3.14";
```
- Have a fixed address in memory
- Their value is loaded from this fixed address each place which uses them.
- Usually slower runtime because we need to perform the extra instruction of loading the data from the fixed address. However this could result in a smaller executable file (only when it is used frequently) because it doesn't have to have multiple copies of the value baked into the executable.
- Can be changed at runtime if defined as `mut` but is unsafe

<br>

---
## Scopes and Shadowing
- Shadowing is different from mutation, because after shadowing both variable‚Äôs memory locations exist at the same time. Both are available under the same name, depending where you use it in the code.
- A shadowing variable can have a different type.
```rs
fn main() {
   let a = 10;
   println!("before: {a}");

   { // Shadowed area
      let a = "hello";
      println!("inner scope: {a}");

      let a = true;
      println!("shadowed in inner scope: {a}");
   }

   println!("after: {a}");
}
```

```
before: 10
inner scope: hello
shadowed in inner scope: true
after: 10
```

<br>

---
## Stack vs Heap 
Rust offers full control and safety via compile time enforcement of correct memory management.

<br>

### Stack 
- Continuous area of memory for local variables
- Values have fixed sizes known at compile time
- Extremely fast: just move a stack pointer
- Easy to manage: follows function calls
- Great memory locality

<br>

### Heap 
- Storage of values outside of function calls
- Values have dynamic sizes determined at runtime
- Slightly slower than the stack: some book-keeping needed
- No guarantee of memory locality
